# great-job
This is a LaTeX package that provides a command to make gold stars for you to put on your homework.
Use ``\greatjob`` to get a gold star that says "Great Job". ``\jobjob`` acts similarly, but takes in an argument on what to display. So, ``\greatjob`` 
is equivalent to ``\jobjobn{Great Job}``.
